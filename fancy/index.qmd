### Super fancy stuff
This is a text about super fancy stuff I did. For example, let's have a look at this wonderful R code:
```{r}  
# Generate some multilevel data (my_data) with NED (Level 2), stress (Level 1), mood (Level 1) with 100 participants and 80 occasions each
my_data <- data.frame(
  id = rep(1:100, each = 80),
  NED = rep(rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1), each = 80),
  stress = rnorm(8000, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  mood = rnorm(8000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
)



# Create a multilevel model in which NED (Level 2), stress (Level 1), and their interaction predict mood (Level 1)

mod <- lmerTest::lmer(mood ~ stress * NED + (1 + stress| id), data = my_data)

# Output
summary(mod)
```
